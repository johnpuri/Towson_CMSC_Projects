## Installation Instructions

To get started with any project, clone the repository with submodules and follow the installation instructions specific to each project folder.

```bash
# Clone the repository with all submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/johnpuri/Towson_CMSC_Projects.git
cd Towson_CMSC_Projects

# If you already cloned without submodules, initialize them:
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive
```

## Usage

Each submodule in this repository represents a separate academic project. Navigate to any project folder and refer to its README for specific usage instructions:

```bash
cd Towson_Project_COSC436
# Follow the project-specific README
cat README.md
```
